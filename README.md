# üì∏ Brahmi Memes - The Official Image Library for @[Brahmify_bot]

Welcome! This repository is the official image and GIF library for the **[@Brahmify_bot](https://twitter.com/Brahmify_bot)** Twitter bot‚Äîyour go-to source for the perfect Brahmanandam garu reaction on Telugu Twitter.

The bot's intelligence comes from a database that links his iconic dialogues and expressions to specific situations. This repository stores the visual part of that database: the memes themselves.

## üôå Want to Make the Bot Smarter? Contribute a Meme!

Have a favorite Brahmi moment that you think the bot is missing? You can add it! The process is simple: **add the image, get its URL, and fill out our contribution form.**

Here‚Äôs the step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Add the Meme Image to this Repository

First, we need to host the image file. If the image you want to use is already in this repository, you can skip to Step 2.

**The Easiest Way (for non-developers):**
1.  On the main page of this repository, click `Add file` > `Upload files`.
2.  Drag and drop your meme image or GIF into the box.
3.  **Use a simple, descriptive filename.** For example: `adhurs_innocent.gif` or `dookudu_overaction.jpg`. Please use lowercase letters and underscores `_` instead of spaces.
4.  Click `Commit changes`.

*(For experienced developers: Feel free to Fork the repo and create a Pull Request. This is the preferred method but not required.)*

### Step 2: Get the Raw Image URL

Once the image is uploaded, you need its direct link. This is the most important step!

1.  Find and click on the image file you just uploaded in the repository file list.
2.  On the image preview page, you will see a **"Download"** button.
3.  **Right-click** on that **"Download"** button and select **"Copy Link Address"**.



This copied link is the "raw" URL that the bot needs.

‚úÖ **A correct URL looks like this:**
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[USERNAME]/[REPO_NAME]/main/image-name.jpg`

‚ùå **An incorrect URL looks like this:**
`https://github.com/[USERNAME]/[REPO_NAME]/blob/main/image-name.jpg`

### Step 3: Fill Out the Contribution Form

Now that you have your raw image URL, you can submit all the details to the bot's database.

Fill out the form with the dialogue, context, and the URL you just copied. The more descriptive you are about the context, the smarter the bot will become at using your meme correctly!
